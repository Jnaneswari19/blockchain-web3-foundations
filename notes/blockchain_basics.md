# Blockchain & Web3 Fundamentals

## 1. Blockchain Architecture
- **Distributed Ledger**: A decentralized record of transactions maintained across multiple nodes.
- **Blocks & Chains**: Each block contains verified transactions; blocks are cryptographically linked to form a chain.
- **Immutability**: Once added, data cannot be changed without consensus, ensuring trust and transparency.

## 2. Consensus Mechanisms
- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Miners solve cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions (used by Bitcoin).
- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: Validators stake tokens to propose and validate blocks (used by Ethereum now).
- **Purpose**: Achieve agreement across the network without central authority.

## 3. Cryptographic Principles
- **Hashing**: Converts data into a fixed-length string (e.g., SHA-256).
- **Public/Private Keys**: Public key = wallet address; Private key = signing authority.
- **Digital Signatures**: Authenticate transactions and prove ownership.

## 4. Smart Contracts
- **Definition**: Self-executing code deployed on the blockchain.
- **Lifecycle**: Deployment → Execution → Gas fees → Finality.
- **Use Cases**: Token swaps, NFT minting, lending protocols, DAOs.

## 5. Web2 vs Web3
| Feature       | Web2                          | Web3                              |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Control       | Centralized (Google, Meta)    | Decentralized (Ethereum, IPFS)    |
| Identity      | Email/password                | Wallet-based (MetaMask, Ledger)   |
| Data Storage  | Server-based                  | Distributed ledger/IPFS           |
| Monetization  | Platform-owned                | User-owned (tokens, NFTs)         |

## 6. Key Takeaways
- Blockchain enables **trustless, decentralized record-keeping**.
- Smart contracts allow **automated, transparent execution** of agreements.
- Web3 shifts control from platforms to **users via wallets and DApps**.
