# Blockchain & Web3 Fundamentals

## 1. Blockchain Architecture
- **Distributed Ledger**: A shared record of transactions maintained across many nodes.
- **Blocks & Chains**: Each block contains transactions; blocks are linked cryptographically to form a chain.
- **Immutability**: Once data is added, it cannot be altered without consensus.

## 2. Consensus Mechanisms
- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Miners solve puzzles to validate transactions (used by Bitcoin).
- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: Validators stake coins to secure the network (used by Ethereum now).
- **Goal**: Ensure agreement across all nodes without a central authority.

## 3. Cryptographic Principles
- **Hashing**: Converts data into a fixed-length string (e.g., SHA-256).
- **Public/Private Keys**: Public key = address, Private key = signing authority.
- **Digital Signatures**: Prove authenticity of transactions.

## 4. Smart Contracts
- **Definition**: Self-executing code stored on the blockchain.
- **Lifecycle**: Deployment → Execution → Gas fees → Transaction finality.
- **Use Cases**: Token swaps, NFT minting, decentralized finance (DeFi).

## 5. Web2 vs Web3
- **Web2**: Centralized platforms (Google, Facebook) control user data.
- **Web3**: Decentralized applications (DApps) give users sovereignty.
- **Wallets**: Act as digital identities; “Not your keys, not your coins.”

## 6. Key Takeaways
- Blockchain = trustless, decentralized record system.
- Smart contracts = programmable agreements without intermediaries.
- Web3 = user-owned internet powered by wallets and decentralized apps.
